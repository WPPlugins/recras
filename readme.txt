Easily integrate data from your Recras instance, such as packages and contact forms, into your own website.

== Description ==
With this plugin, you can easily integrate data from your [Recras](https://recras.nl/) instance, such as packages and contact forms, into your own website.

To get started, go to the Recras -> Settings page and enter your Recras name. For example, if you log in to Recras at `https://mysite.recras.nl/` then your Recras name is `mysite`. Since currently only publicly available data can be used in this plugin, that's all there is to it! You can now use shortcodes to retrieve data. All data is retrieved via a secured connection (HTTPS) to ensure data integrity. Other than the request parameters, no data is sent to the Recras servers.

This plugin consists of four shortcodes. To use them, you first need to set your Recras name on the Recras -> Settings page.

= Settings =
Setting your Recras name is the most important step here. Other settings are:

* Currency symbol - set to â‚¬ (Euro) by default.
* Decimal separator - set to , (comma) by default. Used in prices such as 100,00.
* Use date/time picker script - please see the Date/Time picker section for details.

= Packages =
Add the `[recras-package]` shortcode anywhere on your site. The following parameters are supported:

* id (required) - corresponds to the package ID in Recras
* show (required) - can be any of the following: `title`, `persons`, `price_pp_excl_vat`, `price_pp_incl_vat`, `price_total_excl_vat`, `price_total_incl_vat`, `programme`. `program` is included as alias for `programme`.
  * description - shows the long description of this package
  * duration - shows the duration of this package (i.e. time between start of first activity and end of last activity)
  * image_url - gives the package image URL, if present. Note: any surrounding HTML/CSS, such as an `<img>` tag or `background-image` attribute will have to be written manually for maximum flexibility. When using quotation marks, be sure to use different marks in the shortcode and the surrounding code, or the image will not show.
  * location - shows the starting location of this package
  * persons - shows the minimum number of persons needed for this package
  * price_pp_excl_vat - shows the price per person, excluding VAT
  * price_pp_incl_vat - same as above, but including VAT
  * price_total_excl_vat - shows the total price, excluding VAT
  * price_total_incl_vat - same as above, but including VAT
  * programme - shows the programme as an HTML table. For styling purposes, the table has a `recras-programme` class. For multi-day programmes every `tr` starting on a new day has a `new-day` class
  * title - shows the title (display name) of the package
* starttime - only used for `programme`, determines the starting time of a package. If not set, it will default to 12:00
* showheader - only used for `programme`, determines if the header should be shown. Enabled by default, to disable use `false`, `0`, or `no` as value.

Example: `[recras-package id="1" show="title"]` (quotation marks around parameters are optional) will show the title of the package with ID 1.

= Contact forms =
Add the `[recras-contact]` shortcode anywhere on your site. The following parameters are supported:

* id (required) - corresponds to the contact form ID in Recras
* showtitle - show the title of the contact form or not. Enabled by default, to disable use `false`, `0`, or `no` as value.
* arrangement - for forms where the user can select a package, setting this parameter will select the package automatically and hide the field for the user.
* element - show the contact form as definition list (dl - default), ordered list (ol), or table (table).
* showlabels - show the label for each element. Enabled by default, to disable use `false`, `0`, or `no` as value.
* showplaceholders - show the placeholder for each element. Enabled by default, to disable use `false`, `0`, or `no` as value. Placeholders are [not supported](http://caniuse.com/#search=placeholder) in Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower.
* submittext - the text for the form submission button. Defaults to "Send"
* redirect - a URL that the user is redirected to, after submitting the form successfully.

Example: `[recras-contact id=42 showtitle=false element="ol" showlabels="0"]` will show the contact form with ID 42, in an ordered list, without title and without label.

= Online booking =
Add the `[recras-booking]` shortcode anywhere on your site. The following parameters are supported:

* id - corresponds to the contact form ID in Recras

Example: `[recras-booking id=17]` will show the booking form with ID 17.

The online booking shortcode adds an iframe to your site, which automatically adjusts its height to fit the content.

= Products =
Add the `[recras-product]` shortcode anywhere on your site. The following parameters are supported:

* id (required) - corresponds to the product ID in Recras
* show (required) - can be any of the following: `title`, `description`, `price_excl_vat`, `price_incl_vat`.
  * duration - shows duration of this product, if product has a duration
  * image_url - gives the product image URL, if present. Note: any surrounding HTML/CSS, such as an `<img>` tag or `background-image` attribute will have to be written manually for maximum flexibility. When using quotation marks, be sure to use different marks in the shortcode and the surrounding code, or the image will not show.
  * minimum_amount - shows the minimum amount of this product
  * title - shows the title (display name) of the product
  * price_excl_vat - shows the price of the product, excluding VAT
  * price_incl_vat - same as above, but including VAT
  * description - shows the short description of the product
  * description_long - shows the long description of the product, if present.

Example: `[recras-product id="9" show="title"]` will show the title of the product with ID 9.

= Date/Time picker =
By default, date and time pickers use whatever the browser has available. Currently (March 2017) Internet Explorer (all versions), Firefox (all versions), and Safari (desktop) do not have native date/time pickers and only see a text field. We have included a modern looking date/time picker that you can enable on the Recras -> Settings page.

= Styling =
No custom styling is applied by default, so it will integrate with your site easily. If you want to apply custom styling, see `style.css` for all available classes. Be sure to include these styles in your own theme, this stylesheet is not loaded by the plugin!
Styling for the date/time picker can be based off of `datetimepicker/bootstrap-material-datetimepicker.css`. Be sure to make any changes in your own theme, as this file may be overwritten when a new version of the plugin is released.

= Cache =
All data from your Recras is cached for up to 24 hours. If you make important changes like, for example, increasing the price of a product, you can clear the cache to reflect those changes on your site immediately.
